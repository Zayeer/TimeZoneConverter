# TimeZoneConverter

Description:

This is a website where the user selects a city and it will tell them the time difference between that city and their time zone.

The website gets the user's local time automatically and displays it at the top.

Then the user can scroll down and click on one of the cities and the website will display that city's time beside the user's
local time or they can search for the city they want with the search bar at the top of the screen.


Roadmap:

The majority of the programming is already done but there are still a few things left to do.

I would like the search bar to suggest cities based on what letters the user enters (see Search Bar Suggestions in Issues for
more information), also I want to add every major city in the world and then some for the website can display the time for any
city a user can think about.

One last thing, I have not tested this but I don't think that it will work for certain regions during daylight savings time.
So that is something that needs to be fixed, although this can wait since it hasn't been tested yet so it could be a non issue.


Thank you for reading this and thank you even more if you decide to contribute.
